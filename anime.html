The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel. Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history. Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.

He was well on his way to advancing up the hospital's hierarchy until one fateful night. A trivial occurrence would change Dr. Tenma's life forever. A phone call from the hospital director instructed him to perform life-saving surgery on a famous performer rather than the person he had originally planned to operate on. Despite receiving accolades from his colleagues, fiancée, and the hospital director for this achievement, Dr. Tenma felt remorseful for causing the death of an impoverished immigrant worker due to the switch.
                    As a result, he chose to stand firm and work his magic on Johan Liebert, a young boy, rather than the town's mayor when faced with a similar dilemma. However, the decision had serious repercussions for Dr. Tenma, leading to a loss of his social status. The mysterious deaths of the hospital director and two other doctors also had an impact on Dr. Tenma, resulting in him eventually rising to become the hospital director himself after being released without evidence to incriminate him.
                    Nine years later, Dr. Tenma saved a criminal's life, which would bring him face-to-face with the monster he had previously worked on. To make amends for the monster's terrible aftermath, Dr. Tenma must embark on a repentant journey.

Edward and Alphonse Elric become aware of this truth when they try to practice the forbidden act of human transmutation. As a consequence of their mistake, Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse loses his physical form. Edward sacrifices his right arm to preserve Alphonse's soul in a suit of armor, but they are still devastated and alone. Hoping to reclaim their original bodies, Edward becomes a state alchemist and acquires "automail" metal limbs. After three years of searching, they collaborate with military partners to find the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical object that can defy the Law of Equivalent Exchange.
